# Object Detection Streamlit

Welcome to the Object Detection Streamlit project. This project uses Streamlit, a powerful framework for building machine learning and data science web apps, to create a user-friendly interface for object detection.

# Project Structure

The project contains the following main files:

- **object_detection.py**: This is the main Python script that powers the application. It contains the code for the Streamlit interface and the object detection logic.
- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the Python dependencies that you need to run the application.

# Features

This project offers the following features:

- **Real-time object detection**: The application uses state-of-the-art object detection models to identify and label objects in images.
- **User-friendly interface**: Thanks to Streamlit, the application features an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. You can upload an image, perform object detection, and see the results, all from the same interface.
